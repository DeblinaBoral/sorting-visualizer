# Sorting Visualizer | Compare 4 Algorithms in Real-Time

An interactive and visually engaging web application that allows users to compare the performance of four popular sorting algorithms ‚Äî **Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort**, and **Quick Sort** ‚Äî side by side in real-time.

---

##  Features

- **Simultaneous Visualization**  
  All four sorting algorithms animate in parallel panels, helping users visually understand how each algorithm behaves on the same dataset.

-  **Custom Controls**  
  Adjust **array size** and **animation speed** using intuitive sliders.

- **Fun & Functional UI**  
  Color-coded bars, animated gradient background, and smooth transitions enhance understanding and user experience.

-  **Responsive & Clean Layout**  
  Built using plain **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**, and deployed with **GitHub Pages** ‚Äî no frameworks required.

- **Open Source & Deployable**  
  Fully self-contained in a single `index.html` file. Easy to fork, modify, or host.

## The Problem It Solves

Most sorting visualizers available online show **only one algorithm at a time**, making it difficult to compare efficiency or visualize differences. This project solves that by enabling:

- Real-time **side-by-side comparison**
- A clearer view of **relative performance** and **algorithm behavior**
- Better learning through **interactive controls** and feedback

Perfect for **students, educators, or anyone curious about sorting algorithms**.
